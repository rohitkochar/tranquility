/**
  * Wrap a Tranquilizer, exposing an API that is meant to be easy to use for a single caller that doesn't care
  * exactly what happens with individual messages, but does care about having exceptions and counts reported
  * eventually.
  *
  * Exceptions are reported from time to time when you call "send", and always when you call "flush". Only one
  * exception will be reported at a time. Note that exceptions triggered by "send" may not necessarily be related to
  * the actual message you passed; they could be from a previous message.
  *
  * The expected use case of the simple adapter is that if you get an exception from "send" or "flush", you should
  * stop using the adapter and create a new one. It is not meant to make it possible to associate specific exceptions
  * with specific messages.
  *
  * Calling "start" or "stop" on this adapter will start or stop the underlying Tranquilizer. If you want to start
  * or stop the underlying Tranquilizer yourself, then do not call "start" or "stop" on this adapter.
  *
  * The expected use case of this class is that it is used by a single thread.
